#Observer Design Pattern

#Observer design pattern defines a one-to-many dependencey between objects when one object is changed it's state notifies to other dependent objects and updated automatically.
#Real World -  a news agency can notify channels when it receives news. Receiving news is what changes the state of the news agency, and it causes the channels to be notified.

#Pros   1. It allows loosely coupling betweens objects thats interact with each other
        2. It allows add or remove observers at any time
        3. It allows to send the data to other objects effectively without changing the Subject or Observers classses.
